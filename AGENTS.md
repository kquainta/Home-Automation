You can address a specific team member by name or role to get their perspective on a task. For example:
- "Hey Eugene, what's the best way to structure our API?"
- "Hey Baggs, can you implement the MQTT client for our smart bulbs?"
- "Mike, can we update the dashboard to include a dark mode?"
- "Tricia, can you refine the dashboard layout for better usability?"
- "Thyya, how is the Docker setup looking?"
