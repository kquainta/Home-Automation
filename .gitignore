# pyenv
#   For a library or binary, you should probably not check in the .python-version file.
#   For a specific project, it may be useful to check in the file for consistency.
#.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install all dependencies. In that case, it's better to NOT include Pipfile.lock.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/pdm-project/pdm
